# ReturnsStatesStorytelling
In this project, we utilize tableau to analyze different measures through different dimensions of returns happening with superstores throughout seperate states

# Objective/Purpose 
Our objective is to analyze the return activity within the superstore. We take a look at the returns within each subcategory. We analyze the rates of each state. We determine average is the best way to calculate returns rate here, and we take a look at the different dimensions of the return data.
